# Machine Learning Basics
### Linear Regression
This is as simple as machine learning gets. In this program, I clean up some [data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance) containing information about students which I later use to train my program to predict the students' final grades.

This is done by creating a linear regression model based on 10% of the actual data. This process is repeated a 1000 times and the model with the highest coefficient of determination is saved and later used to predict the final grade of the students.

In the plot, midterm grades are plotted against the final grade (although this can be changed by changing the value of "p") in orange and are overlapped by the predictions of the final grade in blue.
